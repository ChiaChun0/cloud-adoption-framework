# Common Data Model

The Common Data Model (CDM) enable [data product interoperability](what-is-data-product.md#data-product-characteristics).

## About Common Data Model

The Common Data Model defines a common language for business entities. Over time, this language covers the full range of your business processes across sales, services, marketing, operations, finance, talent, and commerce. The CDM enables data and application interoperability spanning multiple channels, service implementations, and vendors. It also provides data that self-describes (structurally and semantically), which allows applications to easily read and understand the data.

The following poster shows some elements of the [standard entities](https://github.com/microsoft/CDM/tree/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon) available in the Common Data Model. You can also [download your own copy](https://aka.ms/cdmposter) of the following CDM poster.
