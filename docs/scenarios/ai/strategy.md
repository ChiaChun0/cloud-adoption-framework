# AI Strategy - Recommendations for organizations developing an AI adoption strategy

An AI strategy outlines the organizational process for developing an AI adoption strategy. It helps you identify where AI can add value, select the right solutions, and measure progress. A well-planned AI strategy aligns with your business objectives and ensures that AI projects contribute to overall success. As a first step, create an [AI center of excellence](./center-of-excellence.md) (AI CoE) or appoint an AI lead to oversee your AI adoption.

## Identify AI use cases

AI supports two main goals: enhancing individual efficiency and improving business processes. Generative AI fosters productivity and enhances customer experiences, while nongenerative AI, such as machine learning, is ideal for analyzing structured data and automating repetitive tasks. With this understanding, identify areas across your business where AI could add value.

- *Look for automation opportunities.* Identify processes suitable for automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. Focus on repetitive tasks, data-heavy operations, or areas with high error rates where AI can have a significant effect.

- *Conduct an assessment.* Gather input from various departments to identify challenges and inefficiencies that AI could address. Document current workflows to find areas where AI can automate tasks or provide insights.

- *Explore industry use cases.* Research how other businesses use AI for insights. Stay informed about emerging AI technologies and applications relevant to your industry.

- *Set success metrics.* For each use case, define a success metric to guide your AI adoption. A clear objective shapes the technology you adopt and focuses your efforts.

For more information, see [example AI use cases](#example-ai-use-cases) and [example AI adoption strategy](#example-ai-adoption-strategy).

## Define an AI technology strategy

An AI technology strategy involves selecting the right tools and platforms for each AI use case you identified. Choose between software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), or infrastructure as a service (IaaS) based on your goals and technical needs. The service model you choose affects the [AI shared responsibility](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai) between you and Microsoft. Use the decision tree to narrow down options for each AI use case. After selecting a service, review the skills and data needed to succeed, and consider cost factors to avoid surprises.

### Buy AI software services (SaaS)

Microsoft offers various Copilot generative AI services that enhance individual efficiency. These Copilots allow you to purchase software as a service (SaaS) for AI capabilities across your business or for specific users. SaaS products generally require minimal technical skills.

In terms of data needs, *Microsoft 365 Copilot* uses enterprise data in Microsoft Graph. You can [Categorize your data](/security/zero-trust/copilots/zero-trust-microsoft-365-copilot#step-1-deploy-or-validate-your-data-protection) with sensitivity labels. *Role-based Copilots* have different data connection and plug-in options in ingest data. Most *in-product Copilots* donâ€™t require extra data preparation. *Copilot Studio* automates much of the data processing needed to create custom copilots for various business applications.

### Build AI workloads with AI platform (PaaS)

Microsoft provides various platform-as-a-service (PaaS) options for building AI workloads. The platform you choose depends on your AI goals, required skills, and data needs. Azure offers platforms suitable for different expertise levels, from beginner-friendly tools to advanced options for experienced developers and data scientists. Review the [pricing pages](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/) and use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate casts.

### Bring your own models with infrastructure services (IaaS)

For organizations needing more control and customization, Microsoft offers infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions. While Azure AI platforms (PaaS) are preferred for AI workloads, Azure Virtual Machines provides access to GPUs and CPUs for advanced AI needs. This setup allows you to bring your own models to Azure using virtual machine (VM) images. Refer to the relevant [pricing pages](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/) and the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

## Define an AI data strategy

An AI data strategy outlines data collection, storage, and usage practices that align with regulatory, ethical, and operational standards. This strategy ensures reliable AI outputs and promotes data security and privacy.

- *Establish data governance.* Define data governance principles that ensure AI workloads are transparent, accountable, and compliant with legal and ethical standards. Include categorization of data based on sensitivity and policies to control access, usage, and storage.

- *Plan the data lifecycle.* Specify how you collect, store, process, and retire data. Include retention and disposal policies and use version control to maintain accuracy during updates.

- *Set up AI fairness and bias controls.* Develop processes to detect and address bias in data. Use tools like Fairlearn to ensure models provide fair and equitable outcomes, especially when working with sensitive data attributes.

- *Promote collaboration between AI and data teams.* Align AI development with data engineering efforts to ensure models are built using high-quality, well-managed data. Establish a unified pipeline for AI model training and data updates.

- *Prepare for data scalability.* Forecast the volume, velocity, and variety of data needed for AI workloads. Use flexible architectures to scale with demand and consider cloud-based infrastructures for efficient resource management.

- *Incorporate data management automation.* Plan to use AI and machine learning to automate tasks like tagging, cataloging, and data quality checks. Automation improves accuracy and allows teams to focus on strategic efforts.

- *Plan for continuous monitoring and evaluation.* Establish regular audits of data and model outputs to ensure ongoing data quality, performance, and fairness. Monitor AI models and data pipelines to identify any shifts that might impact reliability or compliance.

## Define a responsible AI strategy

A responsible AI strategy outlines your role in ensuring that AI solutions remain trustworthy and beneficial for all users. You share this responsibility with your AI provider. Your responsibilities vary depending on the technology you adopt.

- *Establish AI accountability.* As AI technology and regulations advance, assign someone to monitor and govern these changes. It's typically a responsibility of the [AI CoE](./center-of-excellence.md) or an AI lead.

- *Align with established responsible AI principles.* Microsoft follows six [responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai#advancing-aI-policy) principles that adhere to the [NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf). Use these principles as business goals to define success and govern your AI adoption.

- *Identify responsible AI tools.* Responsible AI tools ensure that your AI aligns with broader responsible AI practices. As part of your strategy, identify which Responsible AI [tools and processes](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/tools-practices#tabs-pill-bar-oc8dad_tab1) are relevant.

- *Understand legal and regulatory compliance requirements.* Legal and regulatory compliance influence how you build and manage AI workloads. Research and adhere to the requirements governing AI where you operate.

### Example AI adoption strategy

An AI adoption strategy provides a roadmap for integrating AI into your operations. It includes setting goals, identifying AI opportunities, and defining success metrics. By using an AI adoption strategy, you can workloadatically approach AI integration, ensuring it aligns with your mission and delivers measurable benefits. The example is based on a fictional company, Contoso, that has a customer-facing e-commerce application and employs sales representatives who need to forecast business data. The company develops a product and needs to manage inventory for production. Its sales channels include private companies and highly regulated public sector agencies. These agencies require a separate, custom e-commerce app to meet regulations. Here's the company's AI adoption strategy:
