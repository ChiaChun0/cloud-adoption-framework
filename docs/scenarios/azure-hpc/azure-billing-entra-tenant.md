# Azure billing and Microsoft Entra tenants for HPC

Azure landing zones for HPC don't have specific considerations or recommendations that affect billing decisions, enterprise enrollment, or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions.

## Previous recommendations

Keep in mind that it might be important to understand any decisions made previously by the cloud platform team so that you know about existing [enterprise enrollment or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-microsoft-entra-tenant.md).

## Next steps 

The following articles provide guidance on each step in the cloud adoption journey for HPC environments.
